# Generating an infinite sequence, however, will require the use of a generator, since your computer memory is finite:

def infinite_sequence():
    num = 0
    while True:
        yield num
        num += 1


# This code block is short and sweet. First, you initialize the variable num and start an infinite loop.
#  Then, you immediately yield num so that you can capture the initial state. This mimics the action of range().
# After yield, you increment num by 1. If you try this with a for loop, then youâ€™ll see that it really does seem infinite:
for i in infinite_sequence():
    print(i, end=" ")
